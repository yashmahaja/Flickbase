# Flickbase

Flickbase is a picture-sharing web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It allows users to post photos, share experiences, and engage with content. The app features two roles: Admin and Client. Admin users have additional permissions to manage content and users, while clients can browse, post, and interact with photos.
